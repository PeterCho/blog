## Gender-labeled facial data

In our previous blog post, we localized faces within internet photos using
instance segmentation.  In this entry, we continue to accumulate and
investigate a sizable corpus of "faces in the wild".  But now our primary
focus is upon classifying rather than detecting faces.

Humans around the world may be described in terms of various
characteristics which can change on time scales ranging from seconds
(e.g. mood) to decades (e.g. age).  But for most people, gender labels are
constant throughout their lifetimes.  Moreover, physical differences exist
between male and female faces.  So we seek to build a classifer which can
identify gender based primarily upon face imagery input.

We begin by extending our dataset of internet images from our prior face
localization study.  We have collected 13740 images which intentionally
exhibit as much variety as possible.  2815 of the images originated from
the WIDER collection [ref], while the remaining pictures were manually
downloaded primarily from Google Images.  10492 photos in this corpus
contain 43752 human faces which were annotated with bounding boxes via
dlib's image labeling tool IMGLAB [ref].  The labeled faces belong to
people with differing attributes (e.g. gender, age, ethnicity) performing
varying activities (e.g. socializing, swimming, singing) in disparate
settings (e.g. hospital interiors, memorial services, sport stadiums).
Moreover, people's visages are oriented in variable poses (e.g. facing
camera, looking upwards, profile view), and many are partially occluded by
objects (e.g. eyeglasses, drinking cups, other people's heads).  We also
intentionally increased the number of internet images containing faces from
paintings and drawings from our previous face investigation.

While dlib's IMGLAB is convenient for drawing bounding boxes around
objects, it does not currently support hierarchical assignment of multiple
labels per box.  So we developed our own gender attribution tool based upon
the 3D graphics toolkit OpenSceneGraph [ref].  It imports and displays face
bounding boxes generated via IMGLAB. A user may press the "1", "2" or "0"
keys on the number pad to set gender attributes for all bounding boxes in
an image to male, female or unknown.  After a particular box is selected
via the mouse, its gender attribute may be altered to male, female or
unknown by pressing the "1", "2" or "~" keys near the upper left of a
keyboard.  We used this attribution tool to assign gender labels to 40K+
facial bounding boxes.

One example of an image containing multiple gender assignments is displayed
in figure 1.  Purple [cyan] bounding boxes enclose female [male] faces.
Yellow bounding boxes mark persons for which we were significantly
uncertain about their sex.  As we attempted to accurately attribute
thousands of different people appearing in internet images, we were
surprised by how often it is difficult to determine gender from facial and
other appearance cues.  In particular, we found distinguishing baby boys
from baby girls to be nearly impossible if their clothing provided no clear
cultural hints.  In other cases, one can deduce that blurry patches in
images must correspond to human faces.  But such patches may contain too
little information for a gender label to be confidently assigned.  All such
faces marked with "unknown" genders are ignored in our classification
pipeline.

*Fig. 1. An image attributed with gender labels.*

The bounding boxes in figure 1 are snuggly wrapped around individual faces.
But valuable information is contained in hair styles, neckware and
upper-body clothing for gender determination.  So we double all bounding
box widths and heights.  The resulting human head regions come in a wide
variety of pixel sizes.  But a convolutional neural network requires
uniformly-sized imagery input.  In particular, the CNN we developed takes
image chips with 96x96 pixel size.  So chips larger than 96x96 were
subsampled, while chips smaller than 96x96 were superposed onto black
backgrounds.  Examples of head chips extracted from figure 1 and spatially
resized are presented in figure 2.

*Fig. 2. Three female and three male head chips extracted from figure
1.  The chips' pixel sizes are doubled compared to their tightly-cropped
facial bounding box progenitors.*

In order to expand the volume of our training and testing data, we searched
online for other sets of gender-labeled face image chips.  While many
facial databases can be found on the internet [see
www.face-rec.org/databases/], relatively few come with gender metadata.
One relatively recent dataset may be obtained from the OUI-Adience Face
Image Project from which we extracted 17457 photos [see
http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/Adience/data.html; papers].  The
sources for these data are flickr albums, and Adience images are
consequently "in the wild".  We note, however, that flickr users are not
likely to be representative of the global human population.  We also
included 369 head shots of Iranian women available from the Iranian Face
Database [see http://www.iranprc.org/en/ifdb.ph; A. Bastanfard, M.A. Nik
and M. M. Dehshibi, "Iranian Face Database with Age, Pose and Expression",
ICMV 2007.]  After combining all these head shots, we have a total of 54760
image chips with male or female labels.

We randomly reserve 2.5% of the 50K+ chips for validation and another 7.5%
for testing.  Image augmentation is performed upon the remaining 90% of
chips in order to increase the variety of training samples.  The enlarged
bounding boxes surrounding people's heads are translated and rotated by
small amounts.  Half of all the augmented chips are also flipped
horizontally.  Constant random offsets are added to each pixel's hue,
saturation and value color coordinates.  Gaussian noise is also
intentionally injected into augmented images.  Figure 3 displays
representative examples of original and augmented image chips.

*Fig. 3. Examples of imagery augmentation.  Input female and male training
chips appear in the leftmost column of this figure.  Their output variants
are randomly translated, rotated, color-modulated and flipped relative to
the original images.*

For each of the training chips which originated from our highly-variable
set of faces, we add five perturbed counterparts.  But since training chips
from the Adience and Iran Faces databases exhibit less variety, we only add
one augmented variant per chip.  After augmentation, we end up with a total
of 260788 training chips which carry either male or female labels.

The final set of input data comes from images containing no facial content.
Working with our original set of 13.7K+ photos, we randomly choose numbers,
sizes and locations of bounding boxes in each picture.  Any random box
which overlaps a human head is ignored.  Nonface chips are also heavily
biased towards those with sizable image entropies.  We thus generate 99204
non-face image chips, and we reserve 0.5% [1.5%] for validation [testing].
Representative examples of such non-face chips are presented in figure 4.

## CNN Architecture, Parameters and Training

We seek to classify input image chips into one of 3 categories: non-face,
male face or female face.  Since our number of classes is small, we adopt
the hypothesis that a simple convolutional neural network should be
sufficient for our task.  We want to keep the network's overall size as
small as possible in order to minimize its overfitting potential and
required training time.  Yet the network must also have sufficient capacity
to handle our data set's variability.  After experimenting with a number of
different network configurations, we settled upon the one sketched in
figure 5.

*Fig. 5. Training architecture for a CNN used to classify facial genders.
This neural net graph was generated by the web-based Netscope visualization
tool [ref].*

The input to the network is an RGB image chip of pixel size 96x96.
Following the highly successful VGG-16 CNN [ref], we set the pixel
dimensions of all the convolutional filters in figure 5 to 3x3.  The
network's first, second, third and fourth convolutional layers contain 96,
160, 256 and 256 such filters.  Max pooling is performed after the first
three convolutions which reduces the image chip's pixel width and height
each by half.  The fully-connected fifth and sixth layers contain 256 and
256 nodes.  Filtering within layers 1-6 of the network is followed by a
nonlinear ReLU operation.  We also intentionally perform dropout [ref]
after each ReLU step to combat network overfitting.  The dropout
probabilities grow in magnitude with increasing layer depth as follows:
0.1, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5.  Finally, the seventh fully-connected
layer contains 3 nodes corresponding to our non, male and female face
categories.  Softmax probabilities are computed for each category.  The one
with the highest score yields the classification label output corresponding
to the image chip input.

Q: What is the total number of weight and bias parameters in this network?

We implement this network using the caffe framework [ref].  The weights and
biases in the CNN are all initialized with random values drawn from a
Gaussian distribution with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 0.01.  We
train the network using stochastic gradient descent with minibatch size =
??.  We set the initial learning rate = ?? and stepped it down by ??  after
every ?? iterations.  We also experimented with increasing the weight decay
parameter to reduce overfitting and settled upon lambda = ??.

Learning curves are plotted as functions of training epoch in figure 6.  We
instruct caffe to hold out 10% of the input training data in order to
monitor the network's accuracy.  The cyan curve in the figure represents a
temporally-smoothed accuracy metric for the 90% of image chips actually
used to train the network.  The red curve illustrating the same accuracy
metric for the held-out data asymptotes to a value only slightly less than
the cyan curve.  So dropout plus weight decay clearly prevent our CNN from
overfitting.
