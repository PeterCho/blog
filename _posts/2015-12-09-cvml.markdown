I have been interested in organizing large sets of unstructured images for
many years.  I think of this problem as spreading out photos on a large
table like playing cards.  How should the photos on the table be arranged
so that they turn from a random mess into an organized collection which can
be readily searched and extended?

One approach to this organization problem is to build a graph from the
input images.  Each node in the graph corresponds to some image.  And any
two images are connected by an edge whose weight value lies in the range 0
- 100 and indicates similarity.  Two images connected by an edge with
weight 100 are identical.  Two other images connected by an edge 0 weight
are totally different.

So given two images, we need a way to compute their similarity.  Several
years ago, I followed the standard practice within the computer vision
community at the time of extracting and matching SIFT features to assess
image overlap.
