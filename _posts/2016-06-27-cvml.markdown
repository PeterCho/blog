## Faces and hands training data

![FaceLocalization]({{site.url}}/blog/images/face_localization/training_images/training_montage.png)
*Fig. X. Representative examples of training images.  Human faces and hands
are annotated via red and cyan bounding boxes.*

![FaceLocalization]({{site.url}}/blog/images/face_localization/training_images/hands_on_face.png)
*Fig. X. Examples of hands overlapping faces.*

![FaceLocalization]({{site.url}}/blog/images/face_localization/training_images/animal_faces.png)
*Fig. X. Negative examples of human faces and hands intentionally include 
animal pictures.*

*Fig. X. A representative training image which becomes the source for
multiple training chips.*

![FaceLocalization]({{site.url}}/blog/images/face_localization/data_augmentation/output_6x3_tile_montage.jpg)
*Fig. X. Examples of training tiles extracted from figure X.  Note
variations in the translations, colorings and horizontal parities of image
chips.*



## Face instance segmentation

*Fig. X. One example "Friends" image of within our testing set.*

![FaceLocalization]({{site.url}}/blog/images/face_localization/testing_images/good_results/friends/double_full_half_ccs.png)
*Fig. X.  Pixel-level semantic segmentation of faces and hands within
the test image (upper right) and its double-sized (left) and
half-sized (lower right) versions.  Colored bounding boxes indicate
connected components within these masks.*

![FaceLocalization]({{site.url}}/blog/images/face_localization/testing_images/good_results/friends/double_full_half_scores.png)
*Fig. X.  Pixel-level scores for semantic segmentation results of figure X.
Warmer colors indicate higher confidences than cooler colors.*

![FaceLocalization]({{site.url}}/blog/images/face_localization/testing_images/good_results/friends/flattened_segs_04084.png)
*Fig. X.  Semantic segmentation results consolidated across image scales.*


![FaceLocalization]({{site.url}}/blog/images/face_localization/testing_images/good_results/friends/double_full_half_quads.png)
*Fig. X.  Face quadrant segmentation results at 3 different image scales.*

![FaceLocalization]({{site.url}}/blog/images/face_localization/testing_images/good_results/friends/quad_centers_04084_0.png)
*Fig. X.  Extracted face quadrant centers are marked by small white
bounding boxes.  Bounding boxes around original face segmentation connected
components appear in purple.*


![FaceLocalization]({{site.url}}/blog/images/face_localization/testing_images/good_results/friends/segmented_image_04084.png)
*Fig. X.  Localized faces and hands are indicated by orange and green
bounding boxes*.
