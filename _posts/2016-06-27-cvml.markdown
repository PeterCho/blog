## Faces and hands training data

![FaceLocalization]({{site.url}}/blog/images/face_localization/training_images/training_montage.png)
*Fig. X. Representative examples of training images.  Human faces and hands
are annotated via red and cyan bounding boxes.*

*Fig. X. Examples of hands overlapping faces.*

*Fig. X. Negative examples of human faces and hands intentionally include 
animal pictures.*

variations in the translations, colorings and horizontal parities of image
chips.*
