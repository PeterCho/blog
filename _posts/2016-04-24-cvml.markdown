## Digit Chip Data

Automatic digit recognition is a classic problem at the intersection of
machine learning and computer vision.  One of the earliest applications of
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was to recognizing hand-written digits
[1].  Lecun and collaborators assembled their well-known "Modified NIST
(MNIST)" data set consisting of 60K examples of greyscale digits superposed
against 28x28 white pixel backgrounds.  (A few examples of MNIST image
chips are displayed in figure 1.)  In 1998, these authors developed CNNs
which could classify input chips as corresponding to digits 0, 1, 2, ..., 9
with accuracies around 99.3%.  Over the past few years, researchers have
refined CNNs to classify MNIST digits with accuracies approaching 99.8%
[2].

In 2011, a team of Stanford researchers harvested a set of digits from
Google Street View imagery which they dubbed the Street View House Numbers
(SVHN) data set [3,4].  As figure 2 illustrates, SVHN digits exhibit
significantly more variation and complexity compared to their MNIST
predecessors.  Consequently, classifying the former is much more
challenging than the latter.  SVHN digit recognition accuracies around 98%
have been reported in the recent literature [2].
