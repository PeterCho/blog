## Training

![BEGAN]({{site.url}}/blog/images/gans_faces_flowers/training_faces_64x64.png)
*Fig. X.  Tensorboard display of representative face images drawn
from the CelebA training set.*

![BEGAN]({{site.url}}/blog/images/gans_faces_flowers/training_flowers_64x64.png)
*Fig. X.  Tensorboard display of dynamically augmented images drawn from
the combined 17-flower and 102-flower training sets.*

## Results

![BEGAN]({{site.url}}/blog/images/gans_faces_flowers/dcgan_wgan_began_faces.png)
*Fig. X.  Example 64x64 faces generated by the DCGAN (left), WGAN (center) and
BEGAN (right) architectures.*

*Fig. X.  Example 64x64 flowers generated by the DCGAN (left), WGAN (center) and
BEGAN (right) architectures.*

*Fig. X.  BEGAN convergence measure generally decreases as training
proceeds.  But sudden increases in measure value indicates training
instabilities.  Insets illustrate generated 64x64 flower thumbnails at
various times during training.*

*Fig. X.  Representative 128x128 faces generated by the BEGAN architecture.*



## Descriptor space image manipulation

![BEGAN]({{site.url}}/blog/images/gans_faces_flowers/padded_began1_64x64_flowers_linear_interp.png)
*Fig. X.  Linear interpolations between random points in descriptor space
yields smooth transformations between generated flower images.*

*Fig. X.  Generated face corresponding to mean code-vector in descriptor space.*

![BEGAN]({{site.url}}/blog/images/gans_faces_flowers/eigendirs_09_images_006.png)
*Fig. X.  Movements along various eigendirections passing through the
eigencenter face image.*

![BEGAN]({{site.url}}/blog/images/gans_faces_flowers/redlips_grins_mustaches_montage.png)
*Fig. X.  Generated faces corresponding to random descriptors offset along
particular eigendirections exhibit semantically similar traits.  For example,
eigendirection combinations yield faces with red lips and rosy cheeks
(left), wide grins (center) and mustaches (right).*

![BEGAN]({{site.url}}/blog/images/gans_faces_flowers/grinredlips_grinmustaches_montage.png)
*Fig. X.  Taking combinations of semantically-meaningful eigendirections
yields faces with red lips and wide grins (left) as well as mustaches and
wide grins (right)*

![BEGAN]({{site.url}}/blog/images/gans_faces_flowers/neutral_to_grin.png)
*Fig. X.  Movement between points in descriptor space along a particular
combination of eigendirections smoothly adds grins to initially neutral
faces.*
