## Reinforcement learning

Since the breakthrough paper of Krizhevsky et al in 2012 [1], convolution
neural networks have repeatedly been demonstrated to perform a growing list
of useful image processing tasks. 




## Q learning

Traditional backpropagation iteratively applies gradients to adjust the
weights of a neural network and minimize discrepancies between fixed input
image labels and their classifier-generated counterparts.  But

## Deep Q learning

The numbers of nodes in each layer of a CNN are freely chosen
hyperparameters.  We let fully connected layers 5 and 6 in Model II contain
256 neurons.  FC5 and FC6 activation values thus form 256-dimensional
global descriptors for input test images.  But many of the FC5 and FC6
descriptor coordinates are strongly correlated.  So the genuine dimensions
